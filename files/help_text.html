<h3>
Tox21 data visualisation for EU-ToxRisk
</h3>

<p>
Note that Efficacy data has been trimmed to a maximum absolute value of 200%, as very large values can make scatterplots more difficult to interpret.
</p>

<p>
To see the data for different assays, use the 'Assay Name' category browser widget to step through them; this is located at the top of the right-hand panel.
</p>

<p>
To view only data for one or any of the EU-ToxRisk case study compounds, use the set of 'Case Study' check boxes below the Assay Name tool.
</p>

<p>
To highlight the EU-ToxRisk case study compounds while keeping other compounds visible (for the context they provide)...

<ol>
    <li>
    right-click on the scatterplot of interest
    </li>
    <li>
    choose 'Set Marker Size'
    </li>
    <li>
    Set 'Size by' to 'ACS' (scroll down list of columns to see it)
    </li>
</ol>

This is inelegant, but is the best way I have come up with so far!
